# Nevenium

Let's get back to the rolling mantra. If the ball falls out or the time expires, you lose a life.

Collect gems to unlock the exit  and earn extra balls.  Powergems are
worth 5.  Quantum Gems are worth 10.  A ball is awarded for 100 coins.

## Translation

Nevenium uses the gettext approach to translations. We're always
interested in covering more languages. We have a project on Transifex
(see [instructions on the forum][tx]) and we also accept PO files.
